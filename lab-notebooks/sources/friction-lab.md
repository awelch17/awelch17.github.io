## Introduction

This lab attempted to accomplish a couple objectives: first, to calculate the coefficient of kinetic friction between two real objects, and second, to determine whether or not orange peels (substitution for banana peels) are slippery in comparison to other objects.

## Procedure

### Materials

- Electronic Balance
- Spring Scale
- A chosen surface

#### Masses

- Cucumbers of different sizes
- Part of an orange

#### Objects to be tested

- Orange peel
- Tissue

### Method

First, using the electronic balance, record the weights of each object to be tested and each mass to be tested.

Then, for each possible object-mass combination:

Place the mass on top of the object, and then, using the spring scale, record the amount of force required to pull the object-mass combination at a constant speed across the chosen surface.

Then, enter the results into a spreadsheet such that a scatter plot can be generated from the data in which the combined weight of the object and mass is on the X-axis, and the force required to pull the combined object is on the Y-axis.

Importantly, ensure that units are converted properly. If using Newtons (`kg*m/s^2`) for force, then units of mass in the spreadsheet should be converted to kilograms.

Generate such a scatter plot, and create a trendline to fit the data. The slope of the trendline, by definition, should be the coefficient of kinetic friction between the tested object and the tested surface.

| - | - | - | - |
| Orange Peel | 1 | 58.1g | 0.25N |

### Coefficients of Kinetic Friction

| Object | Calculated Coefficient of Kinetic Friction |
| - | - |
| Orange Peel | 5.58 |
| Tissue | 6.3 |

## Potential Errors

The sample size, in my opinion, is rather small. It is evident from the scatter plot that, for given data points, there are occasionally significant deviations from the trendline. A larger sample size would likely result in more accurate results.

Furthermore, there is the possibility that between tests, the conditions of either the surface, the objects being tested, or the general testing environment changed in such a way that would significantly impact the experiment. For example, humidity of the testing environment, wetness of the tested objects, or friction-induced wear on the objects could have all impacted the quality of the data.

## Conclusion

The coefficients of kinetic friction of real-world objects were successfully derived in this lab. Furthermore, these results show that the coefficient of kinetic friction of an orange peel does not differ significantly from that of a tissue. Therefore, it can be concluded that based on this data, an orange peel is not significantly more slippery than a tissue.

The importance of this lab in regard to our overall study of forces is that it gives us a practical application for the concepts related to coefficients of kinetic friction.
