<p>^ How it feels to be on the receiving end of the clay block</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We are familiar with the concept of conservation of momentum, and the mathematics behind calculating momentum and transfers of momentum. It naturally makes sense to find a practical application to demonstrate these concepts. In this lab, we will attempt to indirectly measure how much force a thrower (in this case, Mason Lee and Ben Goodman, who have similar throw strengths) exerts on the object being thrown. This is an interesting application and/or verification of the laws of momentum.</p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Person to throw the object</li>
<li>An object to be thrown (Used: A block of clay)</li>
<li>A receiver for the object on something that can roll (Used: A chair on wheels)</li>
<li>Scale</li>
<li>Stopwatch</li>
<li>Length measuring device (Used: meter stick)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>First, using the scale, measure and record the masses (in kilograms) of both the object to be thrown and the receiver for the object.</p>
<p>Then, across no less than ten trials, perform the following:</p>
<p>Have the designated thrower throw the object at the receiver. Then, note how far the object-receiver combination rolls (in meters), and how long it takes to roll that distance (in seconds).</p>
<p>Record the averages of the times and distances travelled across the attempts.</p>
<p>Using the distance equation, <b>D = RT</b>, find the average rate of travel of the object-receiver combinations.</p>
<p>Then, using the momentum equation, <b>P = MV</b> (where P is momentum, M is mass, and V is velocity), calculate the average momentum of the object-receiver combinations.</p>
<p>Then, using the law of conservation of momentum and the knowledge that the object-receiver combination had the same momentum as the object after it was thrown, calculate the impulse imparted upon the object by the thrower.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Chair weight: 20lb = 9.07kg</p>
<p>Clay weight: 25lb = 11.34kg</p>
<p>Combined weight: 9.07kg + 11.34kg = 20.41kg</p>

<h3>Calculations</h3>
<p>Average time: 7.796s</p>
<p>Average distance: 8.788m</p>
<p>Average velocity: 1.127m/s</p>
<p>Momentum: 20.41kg * 1.127m/s = 23 kg*m/s</p>
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>The momentum of the clay-chair combination has been calculated to be 23 kg*m/s, and so according to the law of conservation of momentum, the momentum of the clay as it was being thrown was also 23 kg*m/s. Since the designated thrower accelerated the clay from a stop, the initial momentum of the clay was 0 kg*m/s. Because impulse is change in momentum, we can conclude that the impulse imparted on the clay by the thrower was, on average, 23 kg*m/s.</p>
<h2>Potential Errors</h2>
<p>The law of conservation of momentum relies on no momentum losses from outside forces. However, there are multiple significant outside forces that could impact our experiment that we did not account for. For example, friction-related energy losses during the collision, friction between the wheels of the chair and the ground, and air resistance all likely significantly reduced the momentum of the chair-clay combination.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because friction between the wheels and the ground significantly impacted the speed of the chair, as shown through the deceleration of the chair to a stop, the measurements taken of the velocity (and, as a result, calculations of the momentum) of the chair are not necessarily representative of the true velocity and momentum imparted on the clay by the thrower.</p>
<p>We also noticed a significant usage of energy to align the wheels in the direction of the momentum. We attempted to alieviate this by pre-turning the wheels, but our attempts likely were imperfect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although we were able to approximate the distance travelled by the chair through the pythagorean theorem, since we do not have the tools to measure the distance along an irregular curve, such as the actual path of the chair, we were unable to measure the precise distance travelled by the chair.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Despite all of these potential errors, this was still an interesting lab and a fun application of the law of conservation of momentum. It was interesting to note that my classmates can throw with around 23 kg*m/s of impulse, which means that they could accelerate a 1 kg object to 23m/s (51 mph!!!), or a 23kg object to 1m/s.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this allows us to put into context what a kg*m/s really means. Knowing that the impulse behind a human throw is in the range of 20kg*m/s allows us to better understand what other measurements of momentum translate to in the real world.</p>
