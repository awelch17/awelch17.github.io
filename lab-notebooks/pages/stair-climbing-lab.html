<p><img alt="" src="https://www.stairs-siller.com/fileadmin/_processed_/6/a/csm_Stair_2_hq_03_1ccf3f1f5c.jpg" /></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The objective of this lab was to determine the amount of work needed to climb a staircase, and the amount of power exerted during that time. Furthermore, these values should be converted to peanuts to provide an effective real-world comparison for the work exerted.</p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scale</li>
<li>Ruler</li>
<li>Stairs</li>
<li>Stopwatch</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>First, measure the weight of the human climbing the staircase. Convert the measurement to Newtons.</p>
<p>Then, measure both the height of each step on the staircase and the number of steps. Using these two, calculate the total height of the staircase.</p>
<p>Then, measure the amount of time the human takes to climb the staircase. Repeat until 10 points of data are obtained.</p>
<p>For each climb, calculate work and power using the following equations:</p>
<p><code>w = ΔPE (graviational) = mgΔ</code></p>
<p><code>P = w/t</code></p>
<p>Since <code>m</code>, <code>g</code>, and <code>Δh</code> should remain constant across each climb, so should work. This value of work should be converted into peanuts using the conversion rate <code>1 peanut = 24 kJ</code>.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Weight: <code>129.1lbs</code> = <code>58.55kg</code> = <code>573.79N</code></p>
<p>Step Height: <code>18cm</code></p>
<p>Step Count: <code>19</code></p>
<p>Total Staircase Height: <code>342cm</code> = <code>3.42m</code></p>
<p><code>Work = mgΔh</code></p>
<p><code>Work = 58.55kg * 9.8m/s^2 * 3.42m</code></p>
<p><code>Work = 573.79N * 3.42m</code></p>
<p><code>Work = 1962.3618J = 1.9623618 kJ</code></p>

<h3>Peanut Conversion (Per Climb)</h3>
<p><code>1.9623618 kJ * 1 peanut/24 kJ = 0.081765075 peanuts</code></p>
<h2>Potential Errors</h2>
<p>This lab only takes into account the work required to change the gravitational potential energy of the object in question (the human) by a certain height. It does not consider the work required for forward movement, overcoming friction, and overcoming air resistance. These are factors that would have to be included to have a truly accurate estimation of the amount of work required to climb a staircase.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the conversion from kilojoules to peanuts does not accurately represent the amount of peanuts a human would have to eat to be able to exert the work required to climb the staircase. An accurate estimation of the number of peanuts a human would have to eat would have to take into account the imperfect efficiency of the human metabolic system.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on the taken measurements, it required approximately 1.962 kilojoules to climb the staircase in question. When climbed in approximately 4.5 seconds, the power exerted is approximately 425W. The amount of work required, converted to peanuts, is approximately 8.17% of a peanut.</p>
<p>This lab is important to our overall study of forces as it gives us a practical application of the concepts related to work, energy, and power. Furthermore, the conversion to peanuts gives us context for what these terms mean in the real world.</p>
