<p><img alt="" src="https://i.imgflip.com/28d06m.jpg" /></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This lab attempted to accomplish a couple objectives: first, to calculate the coefficient of kinetic friction between two real objects, and second, to determine whether or not orange peels (substitution for banana peels) are slippery in comparison to other objects.</p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Electronic Balance</li>
<li>Spring Scale</li>
<li>A chosen surface</li>
</ul>
<h4>Masses</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cucumbers of different sizes</li>
<li>Part of an orange</li>
</ul>
<h4>Objects to be tested</h4>
<ul>
<li>Orange peel</li>
<li>Tissue</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<p>First, using the electronic balance, record the weights of each object to be tested and each mass to be tested.</p>
<p>Then, for each possible object-mass combination:</p>
<p>Place the mass on top of the object, and then, using the spring scale, record the amount of force required to pull the object-mass combination at a constant speed across the chosen surface.</p>
<p>Then, enter the results into a spreadsheet such that a scatter plot can be generated from the data in which the combined weight of the object and mass is on the X-axis, and the force required to pull the combined object is on the Y-axis.</p>
<p>Importantly, ensure that units are converted properly. If using Newtons (<code>kg*m/s^2</code>) for force, then units of mass in the spreadsheet should be converted to kilograms.</p>
<p>Generate such a scatter plot, and create a trendline to fit the data. The slope of the trendline, by definition, should be the coefficient of kinetic friction between the tested object and the tested surface.</p>

<h2>Potential Errors</h2>
<p>The sample size, in my opinion, is rather small. It is evident from the scatter plot that, for given data points, there are occasionally significant deviations from the trendline. A larger sample size would likely result in more accurate results.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is the possibility that between tests, the conditions of either the surface, the objects being tested, or the general testing environment changed in such a way that would significantly impact the experiment. For example, humidity of the testing environment, wetness of the tested objects, or friction-induced wear on the objects could have all impacted the quality of the data.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The coefficients of kinetic friction of real-world objects were successfully derived in this lab. Furthermore, these results show that the coefficient of kinetic friction of an orange peel does not differ significantly from that of a tissue. Therefore, it can be concluded that based on this data, an orange peel is not significantly more slippery than a tissue.</p>
<p>The importance of this lab in regard to our overall study of forces is that it gives us a practical application for the concepts related to coefficients of kinetic friction.</p>
