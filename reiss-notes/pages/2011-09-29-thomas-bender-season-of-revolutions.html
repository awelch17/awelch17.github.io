                <p class="inc-lh">Thomas Bender is a contemporary historian, known for his work as a professor at NYU, his regular contributions to the press, and his books, from one of which this excerpt is taken. In this excerpt, Bender argues that the major revolutions of the 18th century were interconnected events, and he details the lasting consequences of these events. He then discusses the way in which past historians viewed these events, the way in which contemporary historians view these events, and why they differ.</p>

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">Historical memory tends to remember the great revolutions of the eighteenth century quite separately. The French might be contrasted with the American, and the Haitian too often is overlooked beyond the Caribbean. While separate they were, they were collectively a single world-shaping event. French financial and military assistance made possible the American victory, and the resulting French debt compelled the French king to call the Estates General, which triggered the revolution there. And that revolution provided the spark that ignited freedom claims in Saint-Domingue, today’s Haiti, And the success of the Haitian Revolution prompted Napoleon to sell Louisiana to the United States, enabling for the first fine a continental vision for the new United States.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">Historians, particularly in the past, viewed the major revolutions of the 18th century as separate, non-interconnected events. Bender argues that they were, in fact, thoroughly interconnected.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">The Haitian Revolution is rarely associated with the founding era of the American Republic. Yet there are traces here and there. Popular fiction has a better memory of the significance of the Haitian Revolution than does popular history, On the first page of the novel Gone with the Wind (1936), Margaret Mitchell began her description of Scarlett O'Hara by pointing out that Scarlett's mother was "a Coast aristocrat of French descent," a reference, lost perhaps to readers outside of the South, that her family were slaveholders who fled with their slaves during the black Haitian struggle for freedom and independence.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">The significance of the Haitian Revolution, particularly in reference to American history, is often overlooked.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">The Atlantic Ocean was a focus of movement in the age of revolution: for people, ideas, and goods. People on the different continents Africa, the Americas, and Europe--had knowledge of and interest in the other continents, and the emerging culture of print provided a substantial diet of information. For instance, within two months of its signing, the Declaration of Independence was being widely read in Europe, as far east as Warsaw, Poland. Surreptitious copies were circulating in Spanish America, and planters in Jamaica believed that the North American rhetoric of freedom was one of the causes of a slave revolt on the island in 1776.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">The Atlantic Ocean facilitated the transit of people, ideas, and goods. This includes those related to and with knowledge of the at-the-time contemporary revolutions.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">People as well as ideas were in motion. Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan, was a witness and sometime participant in the great events of the era, and he provides a particularly interesting example. A sometime collaborator with the revolutionary leader Simon Bolivar, de Miranda’s circle of friends populated the whole Atlantic world. They included Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, and George Washington in North America, but many Europeans as well: the Marquis de Lafayette, the English philosophers Jeremy Bentham and James Mill, the composer Joseph Haydn, the German-Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, and the historian Edward Gibbon. He was even granted an aristocratic title by Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia. A minor participant in the Enlightenment, he is best described as an enthusiastic consumer of the liberal and liberating ideas of the age. His embrace of the Enlightenment and his cosmopolitan experience helped shape his anti-colonial commutinents, and he became an early leader of the Venezuelan movement for independence.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">Bender introduces Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan who lived through all 3 "major" revolutions, to help illustrate his point.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">His father purchased a captaincy in the Spanish army for him, and he served in North Africa, where he caused some distress because of his open sympathy with the desire of his Moorish opponents to rid their land of foreign military forces. Stationed afterward in Cuba, he was part of the Spanish expedition that, allied with France, aided the rebelling Thirteen Colonies. He took part in the recapture of Pensacola, Florida from the British, and he had a role in assisting the French fleet that made possible the American victory at Yorktown in 1782, In the next year, he left the Spanish army (under a cloud of suspicion of being a spy) and traveled north to see the new American republic.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">As a result of being enlisted in the Spanish army, Miranda takes part in the American Revolution.</p>

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">From the United States he went to Paris, arriving on the eve of the storming of the Bastille. His sympathies were with the revolution, and he commanded a contingent of revolutionary troops in Belgium, But as the revolution turned more radical, his moderation made him suspect. Challenged by Robespierre, a dominant figure in the Terror (1794 95), he was charged with treason. He escaped the guillotine but spent two years in prison, After his release he went to Britain seeking support for Venezuelan revolution, Nothing came of his effort, and he sailed to the United States, where he solicited help from Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, again without success. In New York, however, he found both volunteers and funds for an expedition, which sailed in 1806. The landing in Venezuela was a disaster, many of his volunteers were taken prisoner by the Spanish authorities, but he escaped to London.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">Miranda travels to France where he joins the revolution, but is accused of treason by Robespierre, and narrowly survives. After being released from prison, he slowly scrapes together funds for a Venezuelan revolution which ultimately fails spectacularly.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">A revolutionary moment arrived for Spanish America when Napoleon invaded Spain and deposed the king. Miranda returned to Venezuela and joined the short-lived independent Venezuelan government. He was at its head in 1812 when Caracas was devastated by an earthquake that killed 10,000 people. Simultaneously the city was besieged by superior Spanish forces. Without consulting anyone, he surrendered. That angered Simon Bolivar, the military leader of the anti-colonial movement in South America, who handed Miranda over to the Spanish authorities. They imprisoned him in Spain, and he died in prison six years later.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">After Napoleon invades Spain, Venezuela (and the rest of Spanish America) sees an opportunity to revolt, and Miranda returns to Venezuela to support the Venezuelan independence movement. He surrenders without approval and is handed over to Spain by Simon Bolivar, and dies in their custody.</p>

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">For all of his fervor, he was a moderate. Independence meant more to him than revolution. He preferred the American to the more radical French Revolution. And like nearly all whire revolutionaries in North America, France, and Latin America, he believed freedom had a boundary. Blacks need not apply. He preferred no revolution at all than to suffer the revolution on Saint-Domingue.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">Miranda cared more about independence than revolution, and did not want to include African-Americans in that independence.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">Though he was not a central figure in the eighteenth-century Atlantic revolutions, I begin with Miranda because he exemplifies three of the main themes (and some smaller ones) of this chapter, First, the three great eighteenth-century revolutions were not only close in chronology, but they also were part of a larger and interconnected history of the Atlantic world. Although historians generally treat these revolutions as separate and self-contained entities, their histories were in reality entangled with each other, just as Miranda was caught up in all three revolutions, as well as Venezuela’s. Another central theme we see in Miranda’s story is a pattern of noble words and results that fall short of the rhetoric. While one might fairly charge these leaders with hypocrisy, a longer term perspective reveals that the words had an enduring and important afterlife.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">Bender uses Miranda's life to show the fundamentally interconnected nature of the three "major" revolutions. He also introduces the idea of these revolutions comprising of noble words and disappointing results, but also the idea that these words would have a lasting impact.</p>
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">The long view points to my third and perhaps my most important proposition. If the eighteenth-century Atlantic revolutions did not bring forth egalitarian and democratic polities, they made such positions possible, perhaps even inevitable in the long term. They established new expectations in politics and society: equality and dignity rather than a world of inequality and privilege became an aspiration that would develop over time into a global universal. It was this historical shift that drove Alexis de Tocqueville's study of the French Revolution and his Democracy in America (1835-40).</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">Bender argues that these revolutions (and the previously mentioned "noble words") set a precedent of "equality and dignity rather than a world of inequality and privilege."</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">The "Great Seal" of the new United States may have overstated the acted circumstances at the moment of its adoption, but it captured a larger historical truth: novus ordo seclorum "New Order of the Ages." And the expansion of the means of public discussion--new places of public assemblage, widened literacy, and a massive increase in printed materials facilitated a broad Atlantic-wide discussion of human rights, the idea of popular sovereignty, and citizenship.</p>

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">Seeds were planted, and we are still tending their shoots. The seeding was the work of all three revolutions, not any single one, This age of revolution was that special moment when, as Hannah Arendt put it, "men began to be aware that a new beginning could be a political phenomenon, that it could be the result of what men had done and what they could consciously set out to do." Before this historical moment, the word "revolution" referred to impersonal events, like the revolution of the Earth on its axis or the planets around the sun. The eighteenth century, however, came to understand revolution as something humanly willed. John Adams, upon finishing his and Benjamin Franklin's final edit of Thomas Jeflerson’s draft of the Declaration of Independence, was among the first to articulate this notion of revolution in a letter to his wile, Abigail, dated July 3, 1776:</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">As a result of the three "major" revolutions, people began to believe in the power of the populace to make change in their governments.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">"When I look back to the Year 1761... and run through the whole Period from that Time to this, and recollect the series of political Events, the Chain of Causes and Effects, I am surprised at the Suddenness, as well as the Greatness of this Revolution."</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh"></p>
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">A properly capacious framework for understanding the eighteenth-century revolutions goes beyond even the Atlantic world. The defining context that accounts for the conjuncture of the three late eighteenth-century Atlantic revolutions (and the early nineteenth-century ones in Spanish America) was the global competition of the British, French, and Spanish empires. That competition, particularly between France and Britain, was long lasting, An almost continuous war began in 1689, and did not end until 1815, with the final defeat of Napoleon. The competition produced, among other wars, the hugely expensive Seven Years' War, the world’s first war fought on every continent. Britain's victory in that war was overwhelming. France lost Canada as well as much-valued trading posts in India and Africa. Britain consolidated its territory in India and more than doubled its American empire.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">Bender argues that a proper understanding of these revolutions requires a proper understanding of the rivalries between the British, French, and Spanish empires.</p>
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">The acquisition of vast new territories increased the cost of empire. Needing new sources of revenue, the imperial authorities looked to the colonies. They also undertook administrative reforms, which tended to centralize power and weaken the local colonial institutions of governance, most notably representative bodies, like the lower houses of assembly in the British Colonies, and the judiciary. This was true of Spanish America as well as of the British colonies. "There was resistance to these changes in both North America and South. Spanish America did not achieve independence in the Eighteenth century, as did the North Americans, and the Haitians in 1801, Bue there were significant rebellions in the 1780s in New Granada (Colombia) and the revolt led by Tupac Amaru, the descendant of the last Inca king, in Peru. His insurgency, which was inspired more by indigenous political theories than by the Enlightenment ones that were more prevalent elsewhere, nearly cost Spain the vast territory of the Rio de la Plata Vice-Royalty, from Buenos Aires to Peru and Bolivia, or so a former Spanish colonial official later wrote.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">The costs of the aforementioned rivalries were often times placed on the colonies, resulting in pre-revolutionary resent from them.</p>
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">The removal of France from North America also weakened the position of Native Americans, who had previously been able to play the two European empires against each other. At the same time, the new territories in the Ohio Valley whetted the voracious British American appetite for land. In an effort to concentrate settlers nearer to the coast and to maintain peace with the Indians, the British Proclamation of 1763 established a line following the ridge of the Appalachian Mountains. Settlement west of it was prohibited, a policy that infuriated the colonists, Another policy concerning the newly acquired territories produced further anger, especially in the New England colonies: the British protected the rights of the Catholics of Québec to practice their religion. These policies organizing the former French colony to the north and west of the thirteen colonies, along with the more familiar ones concerning taxation, trade regulations, and the abuse of traditional political and legal rights by the British government, were major causes of the American Revolution.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">When North America became almost uniformly British territory, Native Americans were no longer able to exploit the rivalry between Britain and France. Furthermore, British policies in the wake of their victory against the French led to the American Revolution.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">There were other important outcomes of the Seven Years’ War, but the most important was the French desire for revenge. That was fortunate for the Thirteen Colonies, for it is the reason the French provided the financial and military aid that was decisive for the achievement of independence. Ironically, the French assistance to the republican Americans brought a monarchy already deeply in debt to the brink of bankruptcy. In order to stave off bankruptcy, the French king, Louis XVI, decided to call the Estates General, which had not met since 1614, to convene May 1, 1789, When in mid-June the Third Estate transformed itself into a National Assembly and began drafting a constitution, they were in effect assuming the national sovereignty that historically had belonged to monarchs. Thus began the sequence of events that led to the storming of the Bastille on July 11, 1789. with much more to follow.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">The success of the American Revolution relied on the rivalry between the French and the British, made worse by the French defeat in the Seven Years' War. Furthermore, the cost of supporting the American revolution caused France to revolt against their monarchy.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">There was more than a financial connection between the American and French revolutions. The leaders in both shared the ideas of the Enlightenment, including a commitment to liberty, contempt for feudalism, preference for a free economy, and a belief in the virtue of a secular state. A French noble, the Vicomte de Noailles, who had fought with the Americans at Yorktown and who was asked by Washington to accept the British surrender on behalf of France, introduced the legislation that ended feudalism in France.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">Leaders of both the American and French revolutions shared the ideas of the Enlightenment, often knew each other, and sometimes even fought side by side.</p>

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen was prompted by the American Declaration of Independence. Lafayette, who had fought in the American Revolution, was one of the drafters of the French document, and in that role he consulted with his friend Thomas Jefferson, the minister of the United States residing in Paris. But the French fully understood that there was a difference in situation. They were in the capital of a powerful monarchy, not a distant colony. They also understood that making a claim for equality was more radical in the very hierarchical French society than in the thirteen colonies where, with the very large exception of the enslaved population, there was much greater equality, But neither the American nor the French declaration was intended to include women. Nor did either declaration address the question of slavery. But in France, unlike America, there was a public discussion of both issues in the course of the revolution, and during the radical years of Jacobin dominance, slavery was abolished. Olympe de Gouges raised the issue of equality for women. As American women would later do with the Americus Declaration of Independence at Seneca Falls in 1848, she rehearsed the language of the Declaration of the Rights of Men with women included: "Woman is born free and lives equal to men in her rights." Haiti’s revolution was all about slavery and the color line.

In the 1820s, African Americans regularly celebrated the anniversary of Haitian independence, and David Walker, a free black in Boston, declared in his Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World (1829): "Haiti [is] the glory of the blacks and terror of tyrants." No one was more frightened than Thomas Jefferson, who wrote to James Monroe in 1793 that he was "more & more convinced" that "all of the West India Islands will remain in the hands of people of color, & a total expulsion of the whites [will] sooner or later take place. It is high time we should foresee the bloody scenes which our children certainly and possibly ourselves (south of the Potomac) [will] have to wade through & try to avert them." Four years later, in a letter to another Virginian, he elaborated: "Unless something is done, and soon done, we shall be the murderers of our own children…: the revolutionary storm, now sweeping the globe will be upon us."</p>

If, as the French Declaration of Rights announced, "men are born free and remain free and equal in rights," the free colored of Saint-Domingue -- gens de couleur were prepared to make that claim. Planters tended to grant freedom to mixed-race slaves, many of whom were, of course, their own children, sometimes from legitimate marriages. By 1789, the number of these gens de couleur had increased dramatically, nearly equaling the number of whites (27,548 blacks to 30,820 whites)--all within a vast sea of enslaved Africiuns. At least two-thirds of the enslaved blacks had been born in Africa. Many of the gens de couleur were educated and wealthy, and those in Paris during the early days of the revolution used their wealth and standing to advocate for citizenship, which in 1797 was granted to mulattoes born of two free parents. This was obviously important to the gens de couleur, but is significant in another way: citizenship crossed the color line. In revolutionary France, at least, color alone no longer defined the limits of European citizenship.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">In Haiti, many mixed-race descendants of slaves had both rights and wealth.

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">Saint-Domingue in the late eighteenth century was per square mile unquestionably the wealthiest place on earth, a wealth that depended upon slave labor cultivating coffee and sugar. The logic of freedom in the rhetoric of the French Revolution threatened that profitable regime. While the French in the metropole wavered on the matter of slavery, the enslaved people of Saint-Dominguc took matters into their own hands. In the summer of 1791, about two hundred slaves had begun assembling and plotting in spaces associated with traditional religious practices, where bonds of solidarity were formed. While the gens de couleur made their case in the language of the Enlightenment, these revolutionaries sealed their oath of secrecy in a ritual that was probably of African origin. In mid-August the plot unfolded, with many nights of fire. Together perhaps a hundred thousand slaves revolted and torched more than three hundred plantations in the northern region of Le Cap. Houses were burned. Whites were killed. A planter described the scene: "the fire... covered the sky with churning smoke, during the day, and at night lit up the horizon with aurora borealis...and gave all objects a livid tint of blood."</p>

Toussaint Louverture, the great leader of the revolution, at first sided with the Spanish to fight off the British. He wanted freedom within the French empire rather than independence, but freedom alone required a battle with the French army sent by Napoleon and commanded by his brother-in-law, Charles-Victor-Emmanuel Leelere. Leelere would die in Saint-Domingue, but not until after he made an agreement with Toussaint that ended the fighting. Toussaint may have agreed to end the war because the peace of Amiens between England and France, ratified in March 1802, meant he could not hope for a British alliance. Toussaint also agreed to go to France for further negotiations, but he was arrested upon arrival and jailed, where he soon thereafter died.</p>

By the time Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a successor to Toussaint, did declare the independence of Haiti in 1801, Adam’s successor, Thomas Jefferson, was president. He not only refused recognition, but he embargoed all trade with Haiti to restrict black sailors from spreading the word of a successful slave revolt. The events in Haiti also moved Jefferson to urge legislation ending the importation of slaves in 1808, the earliest date allowed by the Constitution. Ironically, Jefferson’s greatest achievement as president was the gift of Haiti’s Toussaint Louverture: the opportunity to purchase Louisiana at a bargain price. In Napoleon’s mind Louisiana was the breadbasket that would supply foodstuffs for the enormously profitable colony of Saint-Domingue. Without the island, there was little need for Louisiana.</p>

But the anti-colonial and republican aspirations of the eighteenth century persisted, and the ultimately successful Spanish American moves for independence began in the context of Napoleon’s invasion of Spain in 1808. His removal of the Spanish king, to whom the colonies had owed their loyalty, opened the door to independence for all of Spain's continental colonies between 1810 and 1825. So the last phase of the Atlantic Revolutions, like the first, was framed and prompted by the circumstances of the prolonged global war between France and England, which came to an end only in 1815, with the final defeat of Napoleon. And it was not until then that the United States itself achieved practical independence from Great Britain. Before that the English had maintained forts in the Ohio Valley and, along with Spain in Florida, had encouraged Indian attacks and sought to lure western settlements away from the Union.</p>

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">The idea that the American Revolution and early American history generally was part of a larger age of revolutions is both an old but lost idea and a re-emerging one. The classic nineteenth-century historians of the United States-- George Bancroft, Francis Parkman, and Henry Adams -- were aware of the North Atlantic connections of American history generally, though compared to current scholarship they slighted Africa and South America. Some historians carried on this cosmopolitan historiography: W. E. B. DuBois in particular understood the larger dimensions of American history, beginning with his Harvard dissertation on the suppression of the Atlantic slave trade and in his later interest in Pan-Africanism. Similarly, the historian Herbert E. Bolton in his presidential address to the "American Historical Association in 1932 envisioned a common history of the Americas, "The Epic of Greater America." In the 1940s, recognizing the emergence of the United States as the dominant power in the world, two different committees of historians, with the encouragement and support of the U.S. government and the Rockefeller Foundation, proposed that American history be taught in a way that engaged students in its interconnection with world history. A campaign mounted by various organizations ranging from the Daughters of the American Revolution, to the National Associations of Manufacturers, to more than half of the college presidents in the country opposed what they considered a dilution of American history by including material beyond the territorial borders of the United States. The critics, aided and abetted by the New York Times, felt this more cosmopolitan American history would weaken both American identity and resolve during the perilous times of World War II and the subsequent Cold War.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">The idea of the American Revolution being a "part of a larger age of revolutions" is an old idea, originally being noted by "classic nineteenth-century historians of the United States," and some later historians such as W.E.B DuBois. However, for the majority of the 1900s, American history was framed as being largely independent from global history.</p>

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">These concerns produced a trend American historical writing that celebrated "American exceptionalism." "The United States, it was presumed, did not share a history with the rest of the world. It was exceptional, against the norm. Unlike other nations, there was supposedly no class issues and social conflict. The scholarship of the 1950s and early 1960s was thus given the name "consensus" history by its critics. Exceptionalism and consensus history had the effect of isolating United States history from the larger history it in fact shared with other nations.</p>

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">It should be said that the idea that history and the nation were somehow fused dates from the invention of the modern nation-state and the professionalization of historical study in universities in the nineteenth century, Not only did the two develop simultaneously, but they were partners in Germany, where the first generation of American professional historians was trained. History served to make national citizens by providing a past and a collective memory that all could share, thus sustaining the notion of a national community as a source of one’s identity. That the nation was the natural subject and carrier of history was part of the professional culture of the discipline of history. This understanding was evident in historical scholarship on both sides of the Atlantic, and those parts of the world (then the greater part) that were colonized were thus outside of history as defined by the profession. They were the domain of anthropology. Thus the peoples of most of Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean were excluded from history as understood in academe, as they were ruled as colonies by European nation-empires and thus not themselves nations.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">Much of the "isolated" attitude of earlier historians can be attributed to a "national identity first" approach to history.</p>

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">However, in the 1950s a specific interest in Atlantic history emerged. Partly the reasons were internal to the historical profession. The great works of the French historian Fernand Braudel on "La Mediterranee et le monde mediterranee a l’epoque de Philippe II" (1949) prompted the idea of a history of the Atlantic to match that of the Mediterranean. But an immediate impetus for the emergence of an Atlantic perspective in history was the Cold War. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a Euro-American Cold War alliance, was created in 1949, and it encouraged both political scientists and historians to think about a North Atlantic community as sharing a common history.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">In the 1950s, partially because of the North Atlantic anti-USSR alliance, historians began to focus on Atlantic history rather than the isolated histories of individual nations.</p>

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">A distinguished American historian of the French Revolution, Robert R. Palmer, took up the challenge, as did his French colleague and friend Jacques Godechot. Palmer’s was the more ambitious effort, a two-volume work, "The Age of Democratic Revolution" (1958-64). These pioneering works were limited in their geographies, which, like NATO, embraced only the North Atlantic--Europe and North America. Palmer’s volumes, with more than 1000 pages, had no entry in the index for Haiti. This did not surprise the Haitian anthropologist Michel-Rolfe Trouillot, who insightfully observed that Haiti "entered history with the peculiar characteristic of being unthinkable even as it happened." The new scholarship on the Atlantic world and the Atlantic revolutions has recognized that the three revolutions had both a common history and unique individual histories. With this new perspective it has become easier to grasp the importance of the Haitian Revolution for American history.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">Haiti is notably absent from these early accounts of Atlantic history.</p>

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">Until the 1990s, Palmer’s work was admired more than it was emulated, but then large changes ramified through the discipline. Today, scholarship on the Atlantic world flourishes, and it embraces all four continents with Atlantic shores. European colonizers, once the whole story, are now less central. The study of indigenous peoples in both Africa and the Americas has vastly increased, and even the story of the Atlantic transit has changed. It has been recognized that it was not primarily a European experience. Before 1820, five times more Africans than Europeans made the crossing to the Americas. Palmer’s focus on the democratic character of the revolutions has also been challenged, or, better, modified. The three eighteenth-century Atlantic revolutions were not democratic in their immediate outcomes, and none of the leading figures who consolidated the new nations wanted to establish democracies. None had universal suffrage. Yet the logic of the age of revolution pointed to a rejection of hierarchy in favor of equality and an embrace of citizenship rather than subjecthood.</p>

                        <p class="content-left inc-lh">What accounts for the historiographical shift? Developments in the United States and around the world in the 1980s and 1990s changed the historical imagination. A new way of thinking about history crystallized, a way that realistically recognized that national histories were internally differentiated or diverse and they were part of larger histories. This understanding was prompted by simultaneous discussions of multiculturalism and globalizations in the closing years of the twentieth century. In the context of these discussions, it seemed that for the sake of verisimilitude national histories should be comprised of histories smaller than the nation (the complex play of class, regions, racial and ethnic groups, gender difference and so on) AND histories larger than the nation, extending in some cases to encompass the globe. Just as history includes long durations as well as immediate events, it is constituted by the interplay of multiple geographical scales. The point here is not to abandon or dilute national history; but rather to enrich it by revealing the ways in which historical causation operates across space as well as through time. The age of revolution as presented here reflects those changes in historical scholarship.</p>
                        
                        <p class="content-right inc-lh">In the 1980s and 1990s, partially as a result of greater globalization, historians began to focus more on nationally-interconnected parts of history.</p>

            <p id="raw-text" class="inc-lh" style="display: none;">&emsp;Historical memory tends to remember the great revolutions of the eighteenth century quite separately. The French might be contrasted with the American, and the Haitian too often is overlooked beyond the Caribbean. While separate they were, they were collectively a single world-shaping event. French financial and military assistance made possible the American victory, and the resulting French debt compelled the French king to call the Estates General, which triggered the revolution there. And that revolution provided the spark that ignited freedom claims in Saint-Domingue, today’s Haiti, And the success of the Haitian Revolution prompted Napoleon to sell Louisiana to the United States, enabling for the first fine a continental vision for the new United States.<br>&emsp;The Haitian Revolution is rarely associated with the founding era of the American Republic. Yet there are traces here and there. Popular fiction has a better memory of the significance of the Haitian Revolution than does popular history, On the first page of the novel Gone with the Wind (1936), Margaret Mitchell began her description of Scarlett O'Hara by pointing out that Scarlett's mother was "a Coast aristocrat of French descent," a reference, lost perhaps to readers outside of the South, that her family were slaveholders who fled with their slaves during the black Haitian struggle for freedom and independence.<br>&emsp;The Atlantic Ocean was a focus of movement in the age of revolution: for people, ideas, and goods. People on the different continents Africa, the Americas, and Europe--had knowledge of and interest in the other continents, and the emerging culture of print provided a substantial diet of information. For instance, within two months of its signing, the Declaration of Independence was being widely read in Europe, as far east as Warsaw, Poland. Surreptitious copies were circulating in Spanish America, and planters in Jamaica believed that the North American rhetoric of freedom was one of the causes of a slave revolt on the island in 1776.<br>&emsp;People as well as ideas were in motion. Francisco de Miranda, a Venezuelan, was a witness and sometime participant in the great events of the era, and he provides a particularly interesting example. A sometime collaborator with the revolutionary leader Simon Bolivar, de Miranda’s circle of friends populated the whole Atlantic world. They included Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Paine, and George Washington in North America, but many Europeans as well: the Marquis de Lafayette, the English philosophers Jeremy Bentham and James Mill, the composer Joseph Haydn, the German-Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, and the historian Edward Gibbon. He was even granted an aristocratic title by Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia. A minor participant in the Enlightenment, he is best described as an enthusiastic consumer of the liberal and liberating ideas of the age. His embrace of the Enlightenment and his cosmopolitan experience helped shape his anti-colonial commutinents, and he became an early leader of the Venezuelan movement for independence.<br>&emsp;His father purchased a captaincy in the Spanish army for him, and he served in North Africa, where he caused some distress because of his open sympathy with the desire of his Moorish opponents to rid their land of foreign military forces. Stationed afterward in Cuba, he was part of the Spanish expedition that, allied with France, aided the rebelling Thirteen Colonies. He took part in the recapture of Pensacola, Florida from the British, and he had a role in assisting the French fleet that made possible the American victory at Yorktown in 1782, In the next year, he left the Spanish army (under a cloud of suspicion of being a spy) and traveled north to see the new American republic.<br>&emsp;From the United States he went to Paris, arriving on the eve of the storming of the Bastille. His sympathies were with the revolution, and he commanded a contingent of revolutionary troops in Belgium, But as the revolution turned more radical, his moderation made him suspect. Challenged by Robespierre, a dominant figure in the Terror (1794 95), he was charged with treason. He escaped the guillotine but spent two years in prison, After his release he went to Britain seeking support for Venezuelan revolution, Nothing came of his effort, and he sailed to the United States, where he solicited help from Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, again without success. In New York, however, he found both volunteers and funds for an expedition, which sailed in 1806. The landing in Venezuela was a disaster, many of his volunteers were taken prisoner by the Spanish authorities, but he escaped to London.<br>&emsp;A revolutionary moment arrived for Spanish America when Napoleon invaded Spain and deposed the king. Miranda returned to Venezuela and joined the short-lived independent Venezuelan government. He was at its head in 1812 when Caracas was devastated by an earthquake that killed 10,000 people. Simultaneously the city was besieged by superior Spanish forces. Without consulting anyone, he surrendered. That angered Simon Bolivar, the military leader of the anti-colonial movement in South America, who handed Miranda over to the Spanish authorities. They imprisoned him in Spain, and he died in prison six years later.<br>&emsp;For all of his fervor, he was a moderate. Independence meant more to him than revolution. He preferred the American to the more radical French Revolution. And like nearly all whire revolutionaries in North America, France, and Latin America, he believed freedom had a boundary. Blacks need not apply. He preferred no revolution at all than to suffer the revolution on Saint-Domingue.<br>&emsp;"I confess that much as I desire Liberty and independence in the New World, I fear anarchy and revolution even more. God forbid that the other countries suffer the same fate as Saint Domingue... better that they should remain another century under the barbarous and senseless oppression of Spain"<br>&emsp;A man of grand ambition, middling talent, and few accomplishments, he is remembered in his native Venezuela by the title "Precursor."<br>&emsp;Though he was not a central figure in the eighteenth-century Atlantic revolutions, I begin with Miranda because he exemplifies three of the main themes (and some smaller ones) of this chapter, First, the three great eighteenth-century revolutions were not only close in chronology, but they also were part of a larger and interconnected history of the Atlantic world. Although historians generally treat these revolutions as separate and self-contained entities, their histories were in reality entangled with each other, just as Miranda was caught up in all three revolutions, as well as Venezuela’s. Another central theme we see in Miranda’s story is a pattern of noble words and results that fall short of the rhetoric. While one might fairly charge these leaders with hypocrisy, a longer term perspective reveals that the words had an enduring and important afterlife.<br>&emsp;The long view points to my third and perhaps my most important proposition. If the eighteenth-century Atlantic revolutions did not bring forth egalitarian and democratic polities, they made such positions possible, perhaps even inevitable in the long term. They established new expectations in politics and society: equality and dignity rather than a world of inequality and privilege became an aspiration that would develop over time into a global universal. It was this historical shift that drove Alexis de Tocqueville's study of the French Revolution and his Democracy in America (1835-40).<br>&emsp;The "Great Seal" of the new United States may have overstated the acted circumstances at the moment of its adoption, but it captured a larger historical truth: novus ordo seclorum "New Order of the Ages." And the expansion of the means of public discussion--new places of public assemblage, widened literacy, and a massive increase in printed materials facilitated a broad Atlantic-wide discussion of human rights, the idea of popular sovereignty, and citizenship.<br>&emsp;Seeds were planted, and we are still tending their shoots. The seeding was the work of all three revolutions, not any single one, This age of revolution was that special moment when, as Hannah Arendt put it, "men began to be aware that a new beginning could be a political phenomenon, that it could be the result of what men had done and what they could consciously set out to do." Before this historical moment, the word "revolution" referred to impersonal events, like the revolution of the Earth on its axis or the planets around the sun. The eighteenth century, however, came to understand revolution as something humanly willed. John Adams, upon finishing his and Benjamin Franklin's final edit of Thomas Jeflerson’s draft of the Declaration of Independence, was among the first to articulate this notion of revolution in a letter to his wile, Abigail, dated July 3, 1776:<br>&emsp;"When I look back to the Year 1761... and run through the whole Period from that Time to this, and recollect the series of political Events, the Chain of Causes and Effects, I am surprised at the Suddenness, as well as the Greatness of this Revolution."<br>&emsp;A properly capacious framework for understanding the eighteenth-century revolutions goes beyond even the Atlantic world. The defining context that accounts for the conjuncture of the three late eighteenth-century Atlantic revolutions (and the early nineteenth-century ones in Spanish America) was the global competition of the British, French, and Spanish empires. That competition, particularly between France and Britain, was long lasting, An almost continuous war began in 1689, and did not end until 1815, with the final defeat of Napoleon. The competition produced, among other wars, the hugely expensive Seven Years' War, the world’s first war fought on every continent. Britain's victory in that war was overwhelming. France lost Canada as well as much-valued trading posts in India and Africa. Britain consolidated its territory in India and more than doubled its American empire.<br>&emsp;The acquisition of vast new territories increased the cost of empire. Needing new sources of revenue, the imperial authorities looked to the colonies. They also undertook administrative reforms, which tended to centralize power and weaken the local colonial institutions of governance, most notably representative bodies, like the lower houses of assembly in the British Colonies, and the judiciary. This was true of Spanish America as well as of the British colonies. "There was resistance to these changes in both North America and South. Spanish America did not achieve independence in the Eighteenth century, as did the North Americans, and the Haitians in 1801, Bue there were significant rebellions in the 1780s in New Granada (Colombia) and the revolt led by Tupac Amaru, the descendant of the last Inca king, in Peru. His insurgency, which was inspired more by indigenous political theories than by the Enlightenment ones that were more prevalent elsewhere, nearly cost Spain the vast territory of the Rio de la Plata Vice-Royalty, from Buenos Aires to Peru and Bolivia, or so a former Spanish colonial official later wrote.<br>&emsp;The removal of France from North America also weakened the position of Native Americans, who had previously been able to play the two European empires against each other. At the same time, the new territories in the Ohio Valley whetted the voracious British American appetite for land. In an effort to concentrate settlers nearer to the coast and to maintain peace with the Indians, the British Proclamation of 1763 established a line following the ridge of the Appalachian Mountains. Settlement west of it was prohibited, a policy that infuriated the colonists, Another policy concerning the newly acquired territories produced further anger, especially in the New England colonies: the British protected the rights of the Catholics of Québec to practice their religion. These policies organizing the former French colony to the north and west of the thirteen colonies, along with the more familiar ones concerning taxation, trade regulations, and the abuse of traditional political and legal rights by the British government, were major causes of the American Revolution.<br>&emsp;There were other important outcomes of the Seven Years’ War, but the most important was the French desire for revenge. That was fortunate for the Thirteen Colonies, for it is the reason the French provided the financial and military aid that was decisive for the achievement of independence. Ironically, the French assistance to the republican Americans brought a monarchy already deeply in debt to the brink of bankruptcy. In order to stave off bankruptcy, the French king, Louis XVI, decided to call the Estates General, which had not met since 1614, to convene May 1, 1789, When in mid-June the Third Estate transformed itself into a National Assembly and began drafting a constitution, they were in effect assuming the national sovereignty that historically had belonged to monarchs. Thus began the sequence of events that led to the storming of the Bastille on July 11, 1789. with much more to follow.<br>&emsp;There was more than a financial connection between the American and French revolutions. The leaders in both shared the ideas of the Enlightenment, including a commitment to liberty, contempt for feudalism, preference for a free economy, and a belief in the virtue of a secular state. A French noble, the Vicomte de Noailles, who had fought with the Americans at Yorktown and who was asked by Washington to accept the British surrender on behalf of France, introduced the legislation that ended feudalism in France.<br>&emsp;The French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen was prompted by the American Declaration of Independence. Lafayette, who had fought in the American Revolution, was one of the drafters of the French document, and in that role he consulted with his friend Thomas Jefferson, the minister of the United States residing in Paris. But the French fully understood that there was a difference in situation. They were in the capital of a powerful monarchy, not a distant colony. They also understood that making a claim for equality was more radical in the very hierarchical French society than in the thirteen colonies where, with the very large exception of the enslaved population, there was much greater equality, But neither the American nor the French declaration was intended to include women. Nor did either declaration address the question of slavery. But in France, unlike America, there was a public discussion of both issues in the course of the revolution, and during the radical years of Jacobin dominance, slavery was abolished. Olympe de Gouges raised the issue of equality for women. As American women would later do with the Americus Declaration of Independence at Seneca Falls in 1848, she rehearsed the language of the Declaration of the Rights of Men with women included: "Woman is born free and lives equal to men in her rights." Haiti’s revolution was all about slavery and the color line. As Laurent Dubois has noted, the birth of the new republic was "premised on the self-evident truth that no one should be a slave!<br>&emsp;For that reason the Haitian Revolution, the largest slave revolt in history, was celebrated by blacks throughout the Americas. In the 1820s, African Americans regularly celebrated the anniversary of Haitian independence, and David Walker, a free black in Boston, declared in his Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World (1829): "Haiti [is] the glory of the blacks and terror of tyrants." No one was more frightened than Thomas Jefferson, who wrote to James Monroe in 1793 that he was "more & more convinced" that "all of the West India Islands will remain in the hands of people of color, & a total expulsion of the whites [will] sooner or later take place. It is high time we should foresee the bloody scenes which our children certainly and possibly ourselves (south of the Potomac) [will] have to wade through & try to avert them." Four years later, in a letter to another Virginian, he elaborated: "Unless something is done, and soon done, we shall be the murderers of our own children…: the revolutionary storm, now sweeping the globe will be upon us."<br>&emsp;"The creation of a black republic in the Americas frightened and haunted white planters everywhere. If Jefferson lapsed into hysteria, most planters simply opted for denial. Senator Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina declared on the Senate floor that "Our policy with regard to Haiti is plain." It was that "we can never acknowledge her independence." And the United States did not recognize Haiti until Abraham Lincoln did so in the course of the Civil War."<br>&emsp;The United States also dissociated itself from the French Revolution. At first the citizens of the new republic celebrated their former ally’s challenge to European feudalism and monarchism, But the rise of the radical Jacobins and the violence of the "Terror" in 1794-95, along with the revolution’s "godlessness" and strongly anti-clerical policies, turned most Americans against it.<br>&emsp;For the blacks of Saint-Domingue, the outbreak of revolution in France -- and the rights talk that it stimulated presented an opportunity. If, as the French Declaration of Rights announced, "men are born free and remain free and equal in rights," the free colored of Saint-Domingue -- gens de couleur were prepared to make that claim. Planters tended to grant freedom to mixed-race slaves, many of whom were, of course, their own children, sometimes from legitimate marriages. By 1789, the number of these gens de couleur had increased dramatically, nearly equaling the number of whites (27,548 blacks to 30,820 whites)--all within a vast sea of enslaved Africiuns. At least two-thirds of the enslaved blacks had been born in Africa. Many of the gens de couleur were educated and wealthy, and those in Paris during the early days of the revolution used their wealth and standing to advocate for citizenship, which in 1797 was granted to mulattoes born of two free parents. This was obviously important to the gens de couleur, but is significant in another way: citizenship crossed the color line. In revolutionary France, at least, color alone no longer defined the limits of European citizenship.<br>&emsp;Saint-Domingue in the late eighteenth century was per square mile unquestionably the wealthiest place on earth, a wealth that depended upon slave labor cultivating coffee and sugar. The logic of freedom in the rhetoric of the French Revolution threatened that profitable regime. While the French in the metropole wavered on the matter of slavery, the enslaved people of Saint-Dominguc took matters into their own hands. In the summer of 1791, about two hundred slaves had begun assembling and plotting in spaces associated with traditional religious practices, where bonds of solidarity were formed. While the gens de couleur made their case in the language of the Enlightenment, these revolutionaries sealed their oath of secrecy in a ritual that was probably of African origin. In mid-August the plot unfolded, with many nights of fire. Together perhaps a hundred thousand slaves revolted and torched more than three hundred plantations in the northern region of Le Cap. Houses were burned. Whites were killed. A planter described the scene: "the fire... covered the sky with churning smoke, during the day, and at night lit up the horizon with aurora borealis...and gave all objects a livid tint of blood."<br>&emsp;The island became a focal point of the continuing battle between France and England. Toussaint Louverture, the great leader of the revolution, at first sided with the Spanish to fight off the British. He wanted freedom within the French empire rather than independence, but freedom alone required a battle with the French army sent by Napoleon and commanded by his brother-in-law, Charles-Victor-Emmanuel Leelere. Leelere would die in Saint-Domingue, but not until after he made an agreement with Toussaint that ended the fighting. Toussaint may have agreed to end the war because the peace of Amiens between England and France, ratified in March 1802, meant he could not hope for a British alliance. Toussaint also agreed to go to France for further negotiations, but he was arrested upon arrival and jailed, where he soon thereafter died.<br>&emsp;John Adams, the second president of the United States and leader of a party hostile to France, had earlier provided Toussaint with essential supplies. including military items. Through a special envoy to Toussaint, he indicated that the United States would not oppose a declaration of independence. By the time Jean-Jacques Dessalines, a successor to Toussaint, did declare the independence of Haiti in 1801, Adam’s successor, Thomas Jefferson, was president. He not only refused recognition, but he embargoed all trade with Haiti to restrict black sailors from spreading the word of a successful slave revolt. The events in Haiti also moved Jefferson to urge legislation ending the importation of slaves in 1808, the earliest date allowed by the Constitution. Ironically, Jefferson’s greatest achievement as president was the gift of Haiti’s Toussaint Louverture: the opportunity to purchase Louisiana at a bargain price. In Napoleon’s mind Louisiana was the breadbasket that would supply foodstuffs for the enormously profitable colony of Saint-Domingue. Without the island, there was little need for Louisiana.<br>&emsp;The historian Henry Adams, grandson of one president, and great-grandson of another, wrote in his study of the Jellerson and Madison administrations that this purchase equaled in importance the framing and ratification of the Constitution. And it was, he declared, a gift of the Haitian Revolution, adding that "prejudice of race alone blinded the American people to the debt they owed to the desperate courage of five hundred thousand Haitian negroes who would not be enslaved."<br>&emsp;The sequence of eighteenth-century revolutions that began with the revolt of the thirteen American colonies came to a close with Haiti. But the anti-colonial and republican aspirations of the eighteenth century persisted, and the ultimately successful Spanish American moves for independence began in the context of Napoleon’s invasion of Spain in 1808. His removal of the Spanish king, to whom the colonies had owed their loyalty, opened the door to independence for all of Spain's continental colonies between 1810 and 1825. So the last phase of the Atlantic Revolutions, like the first, was framed and prompted by the circumstances of the prolonged global war between France and England, which came to an end only in 1815, with the final defeat of Napoleon. And it was not until then that the United States itself achieved practical independence from Great Britain. Before that the English had maintained forts in the Ohio Valley and, along with Spain in Florida, had encouraged Indian attacks and sought to lure western settlements away from the Union.<br>&emsp;The idea that the American Revolution and early American history generally was part of a larger age of revolutions is both an old but lost idea and a re-emerging one. The classic nineteenth-century historians of the United States-- George Bancroft, Francis Parkman, and Henry Adams -- were aware of the North Atlantic connections of American history generally, though compared to current scholarship they slighted Africa and South America. Some historians carried on this cosmopolitan historiography: W. E. B. DuBois in particular understood the larger dimensions of American history, beginning with his Harvard dissertation on the suppression of the Atlantic slave trade and in his later interest in Pan-Africanism. Similarly, the historian Herbert E. Bolton in his presidential address to the "American Historical Association in 1932 envisioned a common history of the Americas, "The Epic of Greater America." In the 1940s, recognizing the emergence of the United States as the dominant power in the world, two different committees of historians, with the encouragement and support of the U.S. government and the Rockefeller Foundation, proposed that American history be taught in a way that engaged students in its interconnection with world history. A campaign mounted by various organizations ranging from the Daughters of the American Revolution, to the National Associations of Manufacturers, to more than half of the college presidents in the country opposed what they considered a dilution of American history by including material beyond the territorial borders of the United States. The critics, aided and abetted by the New York Times, felt this more cosmopolitan American history would weaken both American identity and resolve during the perilous times of World War II and the subsequent Cold War.<br>&emsp;These concerns produced a trend American historical writing that celebrated "American exceptionalism." "The United States, it was presumed, did not share a history with the rest of the world. It was exceptional, against the norm. Unlike other nations, there was supposedly no class issues and social conflict. The scholarship of the 1950s and early 1960s was thus given the name "consensus" history by its critics. Exceptionalism and consensus history had the effect of isolating United States history from the larger history it in fact shared with other nations.<br>&emsp;It should be said that the idea that history and the nation were somehow fused dates from the invention of the modern nation-state and the professionalization of historical study in universities in the nineteenth century, Not only did the two develop simultaneously, but they were partners in Germany, where the first generation of American professional historians was trained. History served to make national citizens by providing a past and a collective memory that all could share, thus sustaining the notion of a national community as a source of one’s identity. That the nation was the natural subject and carrier of history was part of the professional culture of the discipline of history. This understanding was evident in historical scholarship on both sides of the Atlantic, and those parts of the world (then the greater part) that were colonized were thus outside of history as defined by the profession. They were the domain of anthropology. Thus the peoples of most of Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean were excluded from history as understood in academe, as they were ruled as colonies by European nation-empires and thus not themselves nations.<br>&emsp;However, in the 1950s a specific interest in Atlantic history emerged. Partly the reasons were internal to the historical profession. The great works of the French historian Fernand Braudel on "La Mediterranee et le monde mediterranee a l’epoque de Philippe II" (1949) prompted the idea of a history of the Atlantic to match that of the Mediterranean. But an immediate impetus for the emergence of an Atlantic perspective in history was the Cold War. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a Euro-American Cold War alliance, was created in 1949, and it encouraged both political scientists and historians to think about a North Atlantic community as sharing a common history.<br>&emsp;A distinguished American historian of the French Revolution, Robert R. Palmer, took up the challenge, as did his French colleague and friend Jacques Godechot. Palmer’s was the more ambitious effort, a two-volume work, "The Age of Democratic Revolution" (1958-64). These pioneering works were limited in their geographies, which, like NATO, embraced only the North Atlantic--Europe and North America. Palmer’s volumes, with more than 1000 pages, had no entry in the index for Haiti. This did not surprise the Haitian anthropologist Michel-Rolfe Trouillot, who insightfully observed that Haiti "entered history with the peculiar characteristic of being unthinkable even as it happened." The new scholarship on the Atlantic world and the Atlantic revolutions has recognized that the three revolutions had both a common history and unique individual histories. With this new perspective it has become easier to grasp the importance of the Haitian Revolution for American history.<br>&emsp;Until the 1990s, Palmer’s work was admired more than it was emulated, but then large changes ramified through the discipline. Today, scholarship on the Atlantic world flourishes, and it embraces all four continents with Atlantic shores. European colonizers, once the whole story, are now less central. The study of indigenous peoples in both Africa and the Americas has vastly increased, and even the story of the Atlantic transit has changed. It has been recognized that it was not primarily a European experience. Before 1820, five times more Africans than Europeans made the crossing to the Americas. Palmer’s focus on the democratic character of the revolutions has also been challenged, or, better, modified. The three eighteenth-century Atlantic revolutions were not democratic in their immediate outcomes, and none of the leading figures who consolidated the new nations wanted to establish democracies. None had universal suffrage. Yet the logic of the age of revolution pointed to a rejection of hierarchy in favor of equality and an embrace of citizenship rather than subjecthood.<br>&emsp;What accounts for the historiographical shift? Developments in the United States and around the world in the 1980s and 1990s changed the historical imagination. A new way of thinking about history crystallized, a way that realistically recognized that national histories were internally differentiated or diverse and they were part of larger histories. This understanding was prompted by simultaneous discussions of multiculturalism and globalizations in the closing years of the twentieth century. In the context of these discussions, it seemed that for the sake of verisimilitude national histories should be comprised of histories smaller than the nation (the complex play of class, regions, racial and ethnic groups, gender difference and so on) AND histories larger than the nation, extending in some cases to encompass the globe. Just as history includes long durations as well as immediate events, it is constituted by the interplay of multiple geographical scales. The point here is not to abandon or dilute national history; but rather to enrich it by revealing the ways in which historical causation operates across space as well as through time. The age of revolution as presented here reflects those changes in historical scholarship.<br></p>
